# Google-HashCode-2019-cpp

Team SicroMoft, score 1.193.508 pts at the Extended Round. 6th in Italy, 63rd in the World.

This code is a little improvements made after the round that gave us 1.2+ mln points, even though there might be some bugs since this version increased the score on some of the input but decreased it on other.

Namely, this algorithm gives the score of 1 point on the a_example.txt file instead of the optimal 2 points.

This is due to the fact that this algorithm starts with pictures sorted by crescent tags number. No further variations have been tested other than random pictures order, that actually gave us higher scores on some input, but needs to run many times in order to find a high score by luck.

Anyway, this C++ algorithm can easily calculate a solution in minutes.

A very slow Python version of the same algorithm is available at https://github.com/michezio/Google-HashCode-2019-python
